Welcome to the Wiki page for the "Ancient Environmental Genomics Course" – an immersive 6-day PhD course designed to equip you with the latest tools and knowledge for unraveling the mysteries of ancient environmental DNA. Whether your curiosity leads you to permafrost soils, lake sediments, ancient artifacts, dental plaque, fossilized excreta, ice samples, or other historical substrates, this course is your gateway to unlocking the secrets of the past.

Our primary objective is to empower you with the essential skills needed to decode the intricate web of DNA preserved in ancient environments. Throughout this course, you will delve into the world of taxonomic profiling, organelle and nuclear DNA placement, and learn to identify a diverse range of species, spanning from microbes to plants, animals, and even our own human ancestors.
